CookBook is an application that is used for sharing recipes between users. 

Each user can add recipe, attach category to it, supply it with description and choose any amount of ingredients from rich database. 
Recipes are public to every user and besides viewing them users can also add their favourite recipes to favourites list and easily access them. 
There is also search option that allows users to find recipes by title or description fragment.
